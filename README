I wanted to work through what I think is a 'fast' workflow with Sencha and Flask

My goal is to accomodate the idiosyncrasies of Sencha Architect so that I can
adopt it as a tool for rapidly prototype interfaces. 

Turns out there is a bit of a learning curve, but I'm sure I'll get the hang of
it and be able to turn small projects faster. This one is significantly under
featured, however I thought it was a good example to start with.

Felix Hummel had basically the same work here: 
https://github.com/felixhummel/flask-extjs-file-upload-example

Felix does a couple things that I couldn't take for granted on this excercise:
 - Hand builds the extjs code (This is generated by Sencha Architect)
 - Hand builds the templating (This is generated by Sencha Architect)
 - Returns text as a response (I wanted to use flask's built in jsonify)

To get this steaming pile of code running on your machine do this:
$ virtualenv flask-extjs-uploader-env
$ source flask-extjs-uploader/bin/activate
$ git clone git://github.com/storrgie/flask-extjs-uploader.git
$ cd flask-extjs-uploader
$ mkdir uploads
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python app.py

Then hit that thing with your browser
